Following the Initial Closing or Subsequent Closing, as is applicable to the Subscriber, the General Partner will notify the Subscriber of the date and time of such Initial Closing or Subsequent Closing. Subsequent to the Initial Closing or the Subsequent Closing as is applicable to the Subscriber, the General Partner will deliver to the Subscriber participating in such Closing a counterpart of the Partnership Agreement and this Subscription Agreement, which shall have been executed by the Subscriber and the General Partner on behalf of the Fund.\n\n4. Agreements with Other Members. The General Partner and each other Limited Partner has executed and delivered a subscription agreement substantially identical to this Subscription Agreement (except as to the amount of the Capital Commitment of such other Limited Partner), in which such other Limited Partner has agreed to subscribe for, and to purchase from the Fund, an Interest in, and to make Capital Contributions to, the Fund and has made substantially the same representations and warranties as made by the Subscriber herein, with such changes as are appropriate to reflect the legal form and jurisdiction of residence. The purchase of the Interest by the Subscriber, and the purchase of limited partnership interests in the Fund by other Partners are to be separate offers and sales of limited partnership interests by the Fund.\n\n5. Representations of Subscribers Specifically Formed or Recapitalized to Acquire an Interest in the Fund. If the Subscriber is an entity and was specifically formed or specifically recapitalized to acquire the Interest, then such Subscriber hereby represents and warrants to, and agrees with, the General Partner and the Fund as follows:\n\n(a) Compliance with Rule 502(c). The Subscriber has not, nor has any person or entity acting on its behalf, engaged in general solicitation or general advertising in violation of Rule 502(c) promulgated under the Securities Act with respect to the offer and sale of the securities of the Subscriber.\n\n(b) Accredited Investor. Each holder of an equity interest in the Subscriber (each, a \u201cParent\u201d) is an \u201cAccredited Investor\u201d as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act, and the Subscriber has obtained from each Parent certifications, and has obtained from each such Parent information, substantially similar to the certifications made, and the information furnished, by the Subscriber in the Subscriber Questionnaire delivered by the Subscriber to the General Partner in connection with this subscription.\n\n(c) Qualified Client. Each Parent is a \u201cqualified client\u201d as defined in Rule\n\n205-3(d) promulgated under the Advisers Act, and the Subscriber has obtained from each Parent\n\ncertifications, and has obtained from each such Parent information, substantially similar to the\n\ncertifications made, and the information furnished, by the Subscriber in the Subscriber\n\nQuestionnaire delivered by the Subscriber to the General Partner in connection with this\n\nsubscription.\n\n(d) Investment Intent. Each Parent in the Subscriber is acquiring its interest in the Subscriber for its own account for investment, and not with a view to any distribution, resale, subdivision, or fractionalization thereof in violation of the Securities Act or any other applicable\n\n13\n\n[[END OF PAGE 14]]\n\n[[START OF PAGE 15]]\n\nDocusign Envelope ID: 1E9A6500-A3D0-4956-9AC2-CDA707BD160F\n\ndomestic or foreign securities law, and such Parent does not have any present plans to enter into any contract, undertaking, agreement, or arrangement for any such distribution, resale, subdivision, or fractionalization.\n\n(e) Access. The Subscriber has made available to such Parent or its representatives all agreements, documents, records, and books that such Parent or its representatives have requested relating to an investment in the Subscriber. Such Parent has had a full opportunity to ask questions of and receive answers from the Subscriber or a Person acting on behalf of the Subscriber concerning the terms and conditions of its investment in the Subscriber and the Subscriber\u2019s investment in the Fund, and all questions asked by such Parent have been adequately answered to the full satisfaction of such Parent.\n\n(f) Illiquidity; Risk. Each Parent has been advised and understands that substantial restrictions will exist on transferability of limited partnership interests in the Fund, that no market for resale of any such limited partnership interests exists or is expected to develop, that the Subscriber may not be able to liquidate its investment in the Fund and, accordingly, that such Parent may not be able to liquidate its investment in the Subscriber. Such Parent has been advised and understands that any instruments representing the Interest may bear legends restricting the transfer thereof. Such Parent has been advised and understands that investment in the Subscriber entails a very high degree of risk and understands fully the risks associated with the operation of the Fund and the Subscriber, such Parent\u2019s investment in the Subscriber, and the Subscriber\u2019s investment in the Fund.\n\n(g) Economic Loss and Sophistication. Each Parent is able to bear the economic risk of losing its entire investment in the Subscriber by virtue of the Subscriber\u2019s investment in the Fund. Each Parent\u2019s aggregate commitment to investments in the Subscriber which are not readily marketable is not disproportionate to its net worth. Each Parent\u2019s investment in the Subscriber will not cause such overall commitment to become excessive. Each Parent has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that it is capable of evaluating the risks and merits of its investment in the Subscriber.\n\n(h) Investment Company Act. The Subscriber has advised each Parent that the Fund has not been registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act in reliance upon an exemption from registration thereunder, and such Parent understands that the Subscriber\u2019s interest in the Fund may not be sold, offered for sale, transferred, pledged, hypothecated, or otherwise disposed of in any manner that would require the Fund to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. The Subscriber has advised each Parent that the Fund has no obligation and does not intend to register any Interests in the Fund.\n\n6. Representations of the Fund. The Fund represents and warrants to the Subscriber that, as of the date of the Closing at which the Subscriber is admitted to the Fund as a Partner, the Fund shall have been duly and validly organized and shall be validly existing as a limited partnership under the laws of the State of Delaware, shall have full power and authority to own and manage the assets to be owned by it as described in the Partnership Agreement, and to conduct the business in which it intends to engage as described in the Partnership Agreement, and is or will become qualified under the laws of all other jurisdictions in which such qualification is necessary to enable it to engage in such business.\n\n14\n\n[[END OF PAGE 15]]\n\n[[START OF PAGE 16]]\n\nDocusign Envelope ID: 1E9A6500-A3D0-4956-9AC2-CDA707BD160F\n\n7.

The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision hereof under any applicable law shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision hereof, and to that extent the provisions hereof shall be severable.\n\n10. Forced Withdrawal. If any answer provided or background documentation required under this Subscription Agreement or the Subscriber Questionnaire is found to be false, forged or misleading, or in the event of delay or failure by the Subscriber or, if a Partner, the Partner to produce any information required for verification purposes, the Subscriber understands that the General Partner may, in its sole and absolute discretion, require the Subscriber to fully withdraw from the Fund.\n\n11. Additional Information. The Fund, the General Partner and their respective affiliates and agents may request from the Subscriber such additional information as the Fund or the General Partner may deem necessary to evaluate the eligibility of the Subscriber to acquire the Interest, and may request from time to time such information as it may deem necessary to determine the eligibility of the Subscriber to hold the Interest or to enable the General Partner to determine the Fund\u2019s or the General Partner\u2019s compliance with applicable regulatory requirements or the Fund\u2019s tax status, and the Subscriber agrees to promptly provide such information as may be requested.\n\n15\n\n[[END OF PAGE 16]]\n\n[[START OF PAGE 17]]\n\nDocusign Envelope ID: 1E9A6500-A3D0-4956-9AC2-CDA707BD160F\n\n12.

The term \u201cinvestment vehicle\u201d includes an \u201cinvestment company\u201d (whether U.S. or offshore), a company that would be an investment company but for the exclusions provided by Sections 3(c)(1) through 3(c)(9) of the Investment Company Act, or a commodity pool. The term \u201cpublic company\u201d includes all companies that file reports pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or have a class of securities that are listed on a \u201cdesignated offshore securities market,\u201d as defined by Regulation S;\n\nReal estate held for investment purposes so long as it is not used by the prospective \u201cqualified purchaser\u201d or a close relative (generally, a sibling, spouse, former spouse, direct ancestor or descendent, or a spouse of such an ancestor or descendent) for personal or business purposes. However, real estate owned by a prospective \u201cqualified purchaser\u201d who is primarily in the real estate business is includable as an \u201cinvestment\u201d even if it is held by the owner;\n\n\u201cCommodity interests\u201d or a \u201cphysical commodity\u201d held for investment purposes by the Subscriber. \u201cCommodity interests\u201d means commodity futures contracts, options on commodity futures contracts, and options on physical commodities traded on or subject to the rules of (i) any contract market designated for trading such transactions under the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act of 1974, as amended (the \u201cCommodity Exchange Act\u201d), and the rules thereunder, or (ii) any board of trade or exchange outside the United States, as contemplated in Part 30 of the rules under the Commodity Exchange Act. \u201cPhysical commodity\u201d means any physical commodity with respect to which a \u201ccommodity interest\u201d is traded on a market specified in the definition of \u201ccommodity interests\u201d above;\n\nTo the extent not securities, \u201cfinancial contracts\u201d entered into for investment purposes or in connection with investments. \u201cFinancial contracts\u201d means any arrangement that (i) takes the form of an individually negotiated contract, agreement, or option to buy, sell, lend, swap, or repurchase, or other similar individually negotiated transaction commonly entered into by participants in the financial markets; (ii) is in respect of securities, commodities, currencies, interest or other rates, other measures of value, or any other financial or economic interest similar in purpose or function to any of the foregoing; and (iii) is entered into in response to a request from a counterparty for a quotation, or is otherwise entered into and structured to accommodate the objectives of the counterparty to such arrangement;\n\nIn the case of a Subscriber that is a \u201ccommodity pool operator\u201d or an \u201cinvestment\n\n[[END OF PAGE 39]]\n\n[[START OF PAGE 40]]\n\nDocusign Envelope ID: 1E9A6500-A3D0-4956-9AC2-CDA707BD160F\n\ncompany\u201d excepted from registration by Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act, any amounts payable to such Subscriber pursuant to a firm agreement or similar binding commitment pursuant to which a person has agreed to acquire an interest in, or make capital contributions to, the Subscriber upon the demand of the Subscriber; and\n\nCash and cash equivalents (including foreign currencies) held for investment purposes. \u201cCash and cash equivalents\u201d include bank deposits, certificates of deposits, bankers acceptances and similar bank instruments held for investment purposes, and the net cash surrender value of an insurance policy.\n\n\u201cInvestments\u201d do not include other assets which do not reflect experience in the financial markets, such as jewelry, art work, antiques and other collectibles.\n\nFor purposes of determining the amount of \u201cinvestments\u201d owned by a Subscriber, \u201cinvestments\u201d of a parent company of the Subscriber and its majority-owned subsidiaries may be aggregated to meet the minimum \u201cinvestment\u201d amount requirements, regardless of which company is the Subscriber.\n\nFor purposes of determining the amount of \u201cinvestments\u201d owned by a Subscriber that is a natural person, there may be included any \u201cinvestment\u201d held jointly or as community property with such Subscriber\u2019s spouse. In determining whether spouses who are making a joint investment in the Fund are qualified purchasers, there may be included in the amount of each spouse\u2019s \u201cinvestments\u201d any \u201cinvestments\u201d owned by the other spouse (whether or not such \u201cinvestments\u201d are held jointly).\n\nIn determining whether a natural person is a qualified purchaser, there may be included in the amount of such person\u2019s \u201cinvestments\u201d any \u201cinvestments\u201d held in an individual retirement account or similar account the investments of which are directed by and held for the benefit of such person.\n\n## VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS\n\nIn determining the value of \u201cinvestments\u201d in order to ascertain \u201cqualified purchaser\u201d status of a Subscriber, the aggregate amount of \u201cinvestments\u201d owned and invested on a discretionary basis by the Subscriber shall be the investments\u2019 fair market value on the most recent practicable date or their cost provided that the same method must be used for all \u201cinvestments.\u201d However,\n\nIn the case of \u201ccommodity interests,\u201d the amount of \u201cinvestments\u201d is the value of the initial margin or option premium deposited in connection with such \u201ccommodity interests\u201d; and\n\nIn each case, there shall be deducted from the amount of such \u201cinvestments\u201d the following amounts:\n\nThe amount of any outstanding indebtedness incurred by the prospective \u201cqualified purchaser\u201d to acquire such \u201cinvestments\u201d; and\n\nIn the case of a \u201cfamily company\u201d (as defined in Part II, Section B.2 of the Subscription\n\n[[END OF PAGE 40]]\n\n[[START OF PAGE 41]]\n\nDocusign Envelope ID: 1E9A6500-A3D0-4956-9AC2-CDA707BD160F\n\nAgreement), in addition to the amounts specified above, any outstanding indebtedness incurred by an owner of the \u201cfamily company\u201d to acquire the \u201cfamily company\u2019s\u201d \u201cinvestments.\u201d\n\n[[END OF PAGE 41]]",

The term \u201cpublic company\u201d includes all companies that file reports pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or have a class of securities that are listed on a \u201cdesignated offshore securities market,\u201d as defined by Regulation S;\n\nReal estate held for investment purposes so long as it is not used by the prospective \u201cqualified purchaser\u201d or a close relative (generally, a sibling, spouse, former spouse, direct ancestor or descendent, or a spouse of such an ancestor or descendent) for personal or business purposes. However, real estate owned by a prospective \u201cqualified purchaser\u201d who is primarily in the real estate business is includable as an \u201cinvestment\u201d even if it is held by the owner;\n\n\u201cCommodity interests\u201d or a \u201cphysical commodity\u201d held for investment purposes by the Subscriber. \u201cCommodity interests\u201d means commodity futures contracts, options on commodity futures contracts, and options on physical commodities traded on or subject to the rules of (i) any contract market designated for trading such transactions under the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act of 1974, as amended (the \u201cCommodity Exchange Act\u201d), and the rules thereunder, or (ii) any board of trade or exchange outside the United States, as contemplated in Part 30 of the rules under the Commodity Exchange Act. \u201cPhysical commodity\u201d means any physical commodity with respect to which a \u201ccommodity interest\u201d is traded on a market specified in the definition of \u201ccommodity interests\u201d above;\n\nTo the extent not securities, \u201cfinancial contracts\u201d entered into for investment purposes or in connection with investments. \u201cFinancial contracts\u201d means any arrangement that (i) takes the form of an individually negotiated contract, agreement, or option to buy, sell, lend, swap, or repurchase, or other similar individually negotiated transaction commonly entered into by participants in the financial markets; (ii) is in respect of securities, commodities, currencies, interest or other rates, other measures of value, or any other financial or economic interest similar in purpose or function to any of the foregoing; and (iii) is entered into in response to a request from a counterparty for a quotation, or is otherwise entered into and structured to accommodate the objectives of the counterparty to such arrangement;\n\nIn the case of a Subscriber that is a \u201ccommodity pool operator\u201d or an \u201cinvestment\n\n[[END OF PAGE 39]]\n\n[[START OF PAGE 40]]\n\nDocusign Envelope ID: 1E9A6500-A3D0-4956-9AC2-CDA707BD160F\n\ncompany\u201d excepted from registration by Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act, any amounts payable to such Subscriber pursuant to a firm agreement or similar binding commitment pursuant to which a person has agreed to acquire an interest in, or make capital contributions to, the Subscriber upon the demand of the Subscriber; and\n\nCash and cash equivalents (including foreign currencies) held for investment purposes. \u201cCash and cash equivalents\u201d include bank deposits, certificates of deposits, bankers acceptances and similar bank instruments held for investment purposes, and the net cash surrender value of an insurance policy.\n\n\u201cInvestments\u201d do not include other assets which do not reflect experience in the financial markets, such as jewelry, art work, antiques and other collectibles.\n\nFor purposes of determining the amount of \u201cinvestments\u201d owned by a Subscriber, \u201cinvestments\u201d of a parent company of the Subscriber and its majority-owned subsidiaries may be aggregated to meet the minimum \u201cinvestment\u201d amount requirements, regardless of which company is the Subscriber.\n\nFor purposes of determining the amount of \u201cinvestments\u201d owned by a Subscriber that is a natural person, there may be included any \u201cinvestment\u201d held jointly or as community property with such Subscriber\u2019s spouse. In determining whether spouses who are making a joint investment in the Fund are qualified purchasers, there may be included in the amount of each spouse\u2019s \u201cinvestments\u201d any \u201cinvestments\u201d owned by the other spouse (whether or not such \u201cinvestments\u201d are held jointly).\n\nIn determining whether a natural person is a qualified purchaser, there may be included in the amount of such person\u2019s \u201cinvestments\u201d any \u201cinvestments\u201d held in an individual retirement account or similar account the investments of which are directed by and held for the benefit of such person.\n\n## VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS\n\nIn determining the value of \u201cinvestments\u201d in order to ascertain \u201cqualified purchaser\u201d status of a Subscriber, the aggregate amount of \u201cinvestments\u201d owned and invested on a discretionary basis by the Subscriber shall be the investments\u2019 fair market value on the most recent practicable date or their cost provided that the same method must be used for all \u201cinvestments.\u201d However,\n\nIn the case of \u201ccommodity interests,\u201d the amount of \u201cinvestments\u201d is the value of the initial margin or option premium deposited in connection with such \u201ccommodity interests\u201d; and\n\nIn each case, there shall be deducted from the amount of such \u201cinvestments\u201d the following amounts:\n\nThe amount of any outstanding indebtedness incurred by the prospective \u201cqualified purchaser\u201d to acquire such \u201cinvestments\u201d; and\n\nIn the case of a \u201cfamily company\u201d (as defined in Part II, Section B.2 of the Subscription\n\n[[END OF PAGE 40]]\n\n[[START OF PAGE 41]]\n\nDocusign Envelope ID: 1E9A6500-A3D0-4956-9AC2-CDA707BD160F\n\nAgreement), in addition to the amounts specified above, any outstanding indebtedness incurred by an owner of the \u201cfamily company\u201d to acquire the \u201cfamily company\u2019s\u201d \u201cinvestments.\u201d\n\n[[END OF PAGE 41]]",
